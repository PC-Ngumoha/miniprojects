# Secrets API

This is the Application Programming Interface of the _Secrets_ app that I'm building in order to learn more about the nature of user authentication systems.

### My vision:
I want to create a very simple API that enables users to:
- Create, Read, Update & Delete certain information that the users intend to keep private and essentially secret. It's essentially a simple secret ledger.
- Create simple forms of authentication using username, email, password and other information deemed relevant to the process.
- Utilize **JSON Web Tokens** or **JWT** for authentication and possibly social authentication later on in the lifecycle of the project
- Implement password recovery features in this application.
- And possibly utilize advanced techniques such as **Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)** & other industry accepted techniques to verify user identity to better improve the security of the application.
